# Coding-Challenge-12

In this code, I will create an Interactive Drawing Application using the HTML5 <canvas> element and JavaScript. The goal is to allow users to draw shapes (lines, rectangles, circles), apply colors, and clear the canvas. This code emphasizes canvas drawing, event handling, and dynamic visual updates.
